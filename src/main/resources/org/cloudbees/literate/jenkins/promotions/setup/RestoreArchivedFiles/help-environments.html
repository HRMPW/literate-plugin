<div>
    If blank, archived artifacts from all environments will be restored.
    <p/>
    Where the same named artifact exists
    in multiple environments, it is undefined as to exactly which of the duplicates will be restored.
    <p/>
    If non-blank, the value is treated as a list of environments from which to copy from. Environments can be
    separated by whitespace or commas. If necessary <code>\</code> can be used to escape characters and
    matching <code>"</code>, <code>'</code> or <code>`</code>s can be used to quote the environment.
    For example, the value: <code>java, "maven 3.0.4" 'maven "2.2.1"', `maven \`any\``</code> will match any environment
    build containing at least one of the components: <code>java</code>, <code>maven 3.0.4</code>,
    <code>maven "2.2.1"</code> or <code>maven `any`</code>
